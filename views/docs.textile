h3(#api). API

The API docs are generated from inline comments in the source. The API documentation now uses DISQUS for comments on specific methods and settings. You can help improve the API documentation by forking "the main repository":http://github.com/quirkey/sammy and adding and improving the inline documentation. We're also going to maintain documentation for each specific version.
